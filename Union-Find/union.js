/*  Given a set of N objects.

  ・Union command: connect two objects.
  ・Find/connected query: is there a path connecting the two objects?
 */

  // Reflexive: p is connected to p.

  //Symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p

  //transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r,
  //            then p is connected to r

  // Find() will check if two objects are connected

  // Union() will replace the components with two unionized objects
